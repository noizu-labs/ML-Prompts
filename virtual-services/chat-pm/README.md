chat-pm
=============================
The purpose of this simulated tool is to provide a basic ticket management system where tickets can be opened/closed assigned/updated, linked etc. 

It's purpose to allow the simulated agents to prepare pm settings that can be pushed into a toole like jira, trello. Eventually it will be replaced with an external tool that virtual agents may interact with.
